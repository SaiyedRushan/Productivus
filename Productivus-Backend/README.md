# Productivus Backend

This backend project leverages Node.js and Express.js to develop RESTful APIs. In the realm of testing, we employ Jest and Supertest to rigorously assess the API endpoints. Furthermore, this project seamlessly integrates with an AWS RDS-hosted SQL Server database.

## Installation

Before starting up the backend, you would need to create a .env file with the appropriate variables set for your sql server instance.
To get started, first run npm install to install all the dependencies and then you can run npm run start to startup the server.
To run the tests. you can run the npm run test command.
After the backend is running. You can go ahead and startup the frontend in another terminal as well. And that should start up the application fully.
